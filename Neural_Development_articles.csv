The development of the adult nervous system in the annelid Owenia fusiformis,"Allan M. Carrillo-Baltodano, Rory D. Donnellan, Elizabeth A. Williams, Gáspár Jékely, José M. Martín-Durán",Allan M. Carrillo-Baltodano,a.carrillo-baltodano@qmul.ac.uk,2024-02-21,"The evolutionary origins of animal nervous systems remain contentious because we still have a limited understanding of neural development in most major animal clades. Annelids — a species-rich group with centralised nervous systems — have played central roles in hypotheses about the origins of animal nervous systems. However, most studies have focused on adults of deeply nested species in the annelid tree. Recently, Owenia fusiformis has emerged as an informative species to reconstruct ancestral traits in Annelida, given its phylogenetic position within the sister clade to all remaining annelids.","Annelid, Larvae, Neuropeptides, Nervous system",2024
A cell atlas of the larval Aedes aegypti ventral nerve cord,"Chang Yin, Takeshi Morita, Jay Z. Parrish",Jay Z. Parrish,jzp2@uw.edu,2024-01-31,"Mosquito-borne diseases account for nearly 1 million human deaths annually, yet we have a limited understanding of developmental events that influence host-seeking behavior and pathogen transmission in mosquitoes. Mosquito-borne pathogens are transmitted during blood meals, hence adult mosquito behavior and physiology have been intensely studied. However, events during larval development shape adult traits, larvae respond to many of the same sensory cues as adults, and larvae are susceptible to infection by many of the same disease-causing agents as adults. Hence, a better understanding of larval physiology will directly inform our understanding of physiological processes in adults. Here, we use single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to provide a comprehensive view of cellular composition in the Aedes aegypti larval ventral nerve cord (VNC), a central hub of sensory inputs and motor outputs which additionally controls multiple aspects of larval physiology. We identify more than 35 VNC cell types defined in part by neurotransmitter and neuropeptide expression. We also explore diversity among monoaminergic and peptidergic neurons that likely control key elements of larval physiology and developmental timing, and identify neuroblasts and immature neurons, providing a view of neuronal differentiation in the VNC. Finally, we find that larval cell composition, number, and position are preserved in the adult abdominal VNC, suggesting studies of larval VNC form and function will likely directly inform our understanding adult mosquito physiology. Altogether, these studies provide a framework for targeted analysis of VNC development and neuronal function in Aedes aegypti larvae.",NA,2024
Loss of G9a does not phenocopy the requirement for Prdm12 in the development of the nociceptive neuron lineage,"Panagiotis Tsimpos, Simon Desiderio, Pauline Cabochette, Philippe Poelvoorde, Sadia Kricha, Luc Vanhamme, Coralie Poulard, Eric J. Bellefroid",Eric J. Bellefroid,Eric.Bellefroid@ulb.be,2024-01-02,"Prdm12 is an epigenetic regulator expressed in developing and mature nociceptive neurons, playing a key role in their specification during neurogenesis and modulating pain sensation at adulthood. In vitro studies suggested that Prdm12 recruits the methyltransferase G9a through its zinc finger domains to regulate target gene expression, but how Prdm12 interacts with G9a and whether G9a plays a role in Prdm12’s functional properties in sensory ganglia remain unknown. Here we report that Prdm12-G9a interaction is likely direct and that it involves the SET domain of G9a. We show that both proteins are largely co-expressed in dorsal root ganglia during early murine development, opening the possibility that G9a plays a role in DRG and may act as a mediator of Prdm12’s function in the development of nociceptive sensory neurons. To test this hypothesis, we conditionally inactivated G9a in neural crest using a Wnt1-Cre transgenic mouse line. We found that the specific loss of G9a in the neural crest lineage does not lead to dorsal root ganglia hypoplasia due to the loss of somatic nociceptive neurons nor to the ectopic expression of the visceral determinant Phox2b as observed upon Prdm12 ablation. These findings suggest that Prdm12 function in the initiation of the nociceptive lineage does not critically involves its interaction with G9a.","Dorsal root ganglia, Neurogenesis, Somatosensory neurons, Nociceptors, G9a, Prdm12",2024
Imp is expressed in INPs and newborn neurons where it regulates neuropil targeting in the central complex,"Jordan A. Munroe, Chris Q. Doe",Chris Q. Doe,cdoe@uoregon.edu,2023-11-29,"The generation of neuronal diversity remains incompletely understood. In Drosophila, the central brain is populated by neural stem cells derived from progenitors called neuroblasts (NBs). There are two types of NBs, type 1 and 2. T1NBs have a relatively simple lineage, whereas T2NBs expand and diversify the neural population with the generation of intermediate neural progenitors (INPs), contributing many neurons to the adult central complex, a brain region essential for navigation. However, it is not fully understood how neural diversity is created in T2NB and INP lineages. Imp, an RNA-binding protein, is expressed in T2NBs in a high-to-low temporal gradient, while the RNA-binding protein Syncrip forms an opposing gradient. It remains unknown if Imp expression is carried into INPs; whether it forms a gradient similar to NBs; and whether INP expression of Imp is required for generating neuronal identity or morphology. Here, we show that Imp/Syp are both present in INPs, but not always in opposing gradients. We find that newborn INPs adopt their Imp/Syp levels from their parental T2NBs; that Imp and Syp are expressed in stage-specific high-to-low gradients in INPs. In addition, there is a late INP pulse of Imp. We find that neurons born from old INPs (E-PG and PF-R neurons) have altered morphology following both Imp knock-down and Imp overexpression. We conclude that Imp functions in INPs and newborn neurons to determine proper neuronal morphology and central complex neuropil organization.",NA,2023

Follicle-innervating Aδ-low threshold mechanoreceptive neurons form receptive fields through homotypic competition,"Matthew B. Pomaville, Kevin M. Wright",Kevin M. Wright,wrighke@ohsu.edu,2023-04-27,"The mammalian somatosensory system is comprised of multiple neuronal populations that form specialized, highly organized sensory endings in the skin. The organization of somatosensory endings is essential to their functions, yet the mechanisms which regulate this organization remain unclear. Using a combination of genetic and molecular labeling approaches, we examined the development of mouse hair follicle-innervating low-threshold mechanoreceptors (LTMRs) and explored competition for innervation targets as a mechanism involved in the patterning of their receptive fields. We show that follicle innervating neurons are present in the skin at birth and that LTMR receptive fields gradually add follicle-innervating endings during the first two postnatal weeks. Using a constitutive Bax knockout to increase the number of neurons in adult animals, we show that two LTMR subtypes have differential responses to an increase in neuronal population size: Aδ-LTMR neurons shrink their receptive fields to accommodate the increased number of neurons innervating the skin, while C-LTMR neurons do not. Our findings suggest that competition for hair follicles to innervate plays a role in the patterning and organization of follicle-innervating LTMR neurons.","LTMR, Somatosensory neuron, Tiling, Bax, Hair follicle",2023

Thus, we investigated the development of these stem cells in the postnatal and juvenile brain.

Dpr10 and Nocte are required for Drosophila motor axon pathfinding,"Meike Lobb-Rabe, Katherine DeLong, Rio J. Salazar, Ruiling Zhang, Yupu Wang, Robert A. Carrillo",Robert A. Carrillo,robertcarrillo@uchicago.edu,2022-10-21,"The paths axons travel to reach their targets and the subsequent synaptic connections they form are highly stereotyped. How cell surface proteins (CSPs) mediate these processes is not completely understood. The Drosophila neuromuscular junction (NMJ) is an ideal system to study how pathfinding and target specificity are accomplished, as the axon trajectories and innervation patterns are known and easily visualized. Dpr10 is a CSP required for synaptic partner choice in the neuromuscular and visual circuits and for axon pathfinding in olfactory neuron organization. In this study, we show that Dpr10 is also required for motor axon pathfinding. To uncover how Dpr10 mediates this process, we used immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry to identify Dpr10 associated proteins. One of these, Nocte, is an unstructured, intracellular protein implicated in circadian rhythm entrainment. We mapped nocte expression in larvae and found it widely expressed in neurons, muscles, and glia. Cell-specific knockdown suggests nocte is required presynaptically to mediate motor axon pathfinding. Additionally, we found that nocte and dpr10 genetically interact to control NMJ assembly, suggesting that they function in the same molecular pathway. Overall, these data reveal novel roles for Dpr10 and its newly identified interactor, Nocte, in motor axon pathfinding and provide insight into how CSPs regulate circuit assembly.",NA,2022
mRNAs encoding neurodevelopmental regulators have equal N6-methyladenosine stoichiometry in Drosophila neuroblasts and neurons,"Josephine D. Sami, Robert C. Spitale, Michael D. Cleary",Michael D. Cleary,mcleary4@ucmerced.edu,2022-10-15,"N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most prevalent internal mRNA modification in metazoans and is particularly abundant in the central nervous system. The extent to which m6A is dynamically regulated and whether m6A contributes to cell type-specific mRNA metabolism in the nervous system, however, is largely unknown. To address these knowledge gaps, we mapped m6A and measured mRNA decay in neural progenitors (neuroblasts) and neurons of the Drosophila melanogaster larval brain. We identified 867 m6A targets; 233 of these are novel and preferentially encode regulators of neuroblast proliferation, cell fate-specification and synaptogenesis. Comparison of the neuroblast and neuron m6A transcriptomes revealed that m6A stoichiometry is largely uniform; we did not find evidence of neuroblast-specific or neuron-specific m6A modification. While m6A stoichiometry is constant, m6A targets are significantly less stable in neuroblasts than in neurons, potentially due to m6A-independent stabilization in neurons. We used in vivo quantitative imaging of m6A target proteins in Mettl3 methyltransferase null brains and Ythdf m6A reader overexpressing brains to assay metabolic effects of m6A. Target protein levels decreased in Mettl3 null brains and increased in Ythdf overexpressing brains, supporting a previously proposed model in which m6A enhances translation of target mRNAs. We conclude that m6A does not directly regulate mRNA stability during Drosophila neurogenesis but is rather deposited on neurodevelopmental transcripts that have intrinsic low stability in order to augment protein output.",NA,2022

Here we used single cell RNAseq to generate a complete gene expression atlas of the Drosophila larval central nervous system composed of 131,077 single cells across three developmental stages (1 h, 24 h and 48 h after hatching). We identify 67 distinct cell clusters based on the patterns of gene expression. These include 31 functional mature larval neuron clusters, 1 ring gland cluster, 8 glial clusters, 6 neural precursor clusters, and 13 developing immature adult neuron clusters. Some clusters are present across all stages of larval development, while others are stage specific (such as developing adult neurons). We identify genes that are differentially expressed in each cluster, as well as genes that are differentially expressed at distinct stages of larval life. These differentially expressed genes provide promising candidates for regulating the function of specific neuronal and glial types in the larval nervous system, or the specification and differentiation of adult neurons.

Neuroblast competence to generate early-born neurons is terminated when the hb gene relocates to the neuroblast nuclear lamina, rendering it refractory to activation in descendent neurons.

The role of astrocyte‐mediated plasticity in neural circuit development and function,"Nelson A. Perez-Catalan, Chris Q. Doe, Sarah D. Ackerman",Sarah D. Ackerman,sarah.d.ackerman@gmail.com,2021-01-07,"Neuronal networks are capable of undergoing rapid structural and functional changes called plasticity, which are essential for shaping circuit function during nervous system development. These changes range from short-term modifications on the order of milliseconds, to long-term rearrangement of neural architecture that could last for the lifetime of the organism. Neural plasticity is most prominent during development, yet also plays a critical role during memory formation, behavior, and disease. Therefore, it is essential to define and characterize the mechanisms underlying the onset, duration, and form of plasticity. Astrocytes, the most numerous glial cell type in the human nervous system, are integral elements of synapses and are components of a glial network that can coordinate neural activity at a circuit-wide level. Moreover, their arrival to the CNS during late embryogenesis correlates to the onset of sensory-evoked activity, making them an interesting target for circuit plasticity studies. Technological advancements in the last decade have uncovered astrocytes as prominent regulators of circuit assembly and function. Here, we provide a brief historical perspective on our understanding of astrocytes in the nervous system, and review the latest advances on the role of astroglia in regulating circuit plasticity and function during nervous system development and homeostasis.","Astrocyte, Synapses, Circuits, Hebbian plasticity, Homeostatic plasticity, Gap junction",2021

Johnson,seth_johnson@hms.harvard.edu,2020-08-02,"Synapses are the sites of neuron-to-neuron communication and form the basis of the neural circuits that underlie all animal cognition and behavior. Chemical synapses are specialized asymmetric junctions between a presynaptic neuron and a postsynaptic target that form through a series of diverse cellular and subcellular events under the control of complex signaling networks. Once established, the synapse facilitates neurotransmission by mediating the organization and fusion of synaptic vesicles and must also retain the ability to undergo plastic changes. In recent years, synaptic genes have been implicated in a wide array of neurodevelopmental disorders; the individual and societal burdens imposed by these disorders, as well as the lack of effective therapies, motivates continued work on fundamental synapse biology. The properties and functions of the nervous system are remarkably conserved across animal phyla, and many insights into the synapses of the vertebrate central nervous system have been derived from studies of invertebrate models. A prominent model synapse is the Drosophila melanogaster larval neuromuscular junction, which bears striking similarities to the glutamatergic synapses of the vertebrate brain and spine; further advantages include the simplicity and experimental versatility of the fly, as well as its century-long history as a model organism. Here, we survey findings on the major events in synaptogenesis, including target specification, morphogenesis, and the assembly and maturation of synaptic specializations, with a emphasis on work conducted at the Drosophila neuromuscular junction.","Drosophila melanogaster, Synapse, Neuromuscular junction, Bouton addition, Synaptic plasticity, Presynaptic active zone, Cell-adhesion molecules, Trans-synaptic signaling",2020

NBs proliferate throughout larval stages to generate a large number of adult neurons. Their proliferation is protected under conditions of nutrition restriction but the mechanisms responsible are not fully understood. As amino acid transporters (Solute Carrier transporters, SLCs), such as SLC36, have important roles in coupling nutrition inputs to growth pathways, they may have a role in this process. For example, an SLC36 family transporter Pathetic (Path) that supports body size and neural dendrite growth in Drosophila, was identified as a putative Notch target in genome-wide studies. However, its role in sustaining stem cell proliferation and maintenance has not been investigated. This study aimed to investigate the function of Path in the larval NBs and to determine whether it is involved in protecting them from nutrient deprivation.","Amino acid transporter, SLC36, Pathetic, Neural stem cells, Neuroblasts, Notch signalling, Nutrition restriction",2020

"An inducible Cre mouse line to sparsely target nervous system cells, including Remak Schwann cells","Darshan Sapkota, Joseph D. Dougherty",Joseph D. Dougherty,jdougherty@wustl.edu,2020-02-20,"Nerves of the peripheral nervous system contain two classes of Schwann cells: myelinating Schwann cells that ensheath large caliber axons and generate the myelin sheath, and Remak Schwann cells that surround smaller axons and do not myelinate. While tools exist for genetic targeting of Schwann cell precursors and myelinating Schwann cells, such reagents have been challenging to generate specifically for the Remak population, in part because many of the genes that mark this population in maturity are also robustly expressed in Schwann cell precursors. To circumvent this challenge, we utilized BAC transgenesis to generate a mouse line expressing a tamoxifen-inducible Cre under the control of a Remak-expressed gene promoter (Egr1). However, as Egr1 is also an activity dependent gene expressed by some neurons, we flanked this Cre by flippase (Flpe) recognition sites, and coinjected a BAC expressing Flpe under control of a pan-neuronal Snap25 promoter to excise the Cre transgene from these neuronal cells. Genotyping and inheritance demonstrate that the two BACs co-integrated into a single locus, facilitating maintenance of the line. Anatomical studies following a cross to a reporter line show sparse tamoxifen-dependent recombination in Remak Schwann cells within the mature sciatic nerve. However, depletion of neuronal Cre activity by Flpe is partial, with some neurons and astrocytes also showing evidence of Cre reporter activity in the central nervous system. Thus, this mouse line will be useful in mosaic loss-of-function studies, lineage tracing studies following injury, live cell imaging studies, or other experiments benefiting from sparse labeling.","Cre, Tamoxifen, Sparse, Remak, Schwann, Nervous system",2020
Evaluating the effectiveness of anti-Nogo treatment in spinal cord injuries,"Raihan Mohammed, Kaesi Opara, Rahul Lall, Utkarsh Ojha, Jinpo Xiang",Raihan Mohammed,rm758@cam.ac.uk,2020-01-09,"As humans, we cannot regenerate axons within the central nervous system (CNS), therefore, making any damage to it permanent. This leads to the loss of sensory and motor function below the site of injury and can be crippling to a person’s health. Spontaneous recovery can occur from plastic changes, but it is minimal. The absence of regeneration is due to the inhibitory environment of the CNS as well as the inherent inability of CNS axons to form growth cones. Amongst many factors, one of the major inhibitory signals of the CNS environment is the myelin-associated Nogo pathway. Nogo-A, Nogo-B and Nogo-C (Nogo), stimulate the Nogo receptor, inhibiting neurite outgrowth by causing growth cones to collapse through activation of Rho Kinase (ROCK). Antibodies can be used to target this signalling pathway by binding to Nogo and thus promote the outgrowth of neuronal axons in the CNS. This use of anti-Nogo antibodies has been shown to upregulate CNS regeneration as well as drastically improve sensory and motor function in both rats and primates when coupled with adequate training. Here, we evaluate whether the experimental success of anti-Nogo at improving CNS regeneration can be carried over into the clinical setting to treat spinal cord injuries (SCI) and their symptoms successfully. Furthermore, we also discuss potential methods to improve the current treatment and any developmental obstacles.","Axon, CNS, Regeneration, Myelin, Nogo",2020

However, the underlying mechanisms by which microglia regulate neuron function remain poorly understood in part because such analysis is challenging in the brain where neurons and synapses are intermingled and connectivity is only beginning to be mapped. Here, we discuss the features and function of microglia in the ordered mammalian retina where the laminar organization of neurons and synapses facilitates such molecular studies. We discuss microglia origins and consider the evidence for molecularly distinct microglia subpopulations and their potential for differential roles with a particular focus on the early stages of retina development. We then review the models and methods used for the study of these cells and discuss emerging data that link retina microglia to the genesis and survival of particular retina cell subtypes. We also highlight potential roles for microglia in shaping the development and organization of the vasculature and discuss cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in this process.

The model of local axon homeostasis - explaining the role and regulation of microtubule bundles in axon maintenance and pathology,"Ines Hahn, André Voelzmann, Yu-Ting Liew, Beatriz Costa-Gomes, Andreas Prokop",Andreas Prokop,Andreas.Prokop@manchester.ac.uk,2019-11-09,"Axons are the slender, cable-like, up to meter-long projections of neurons that electrically wire our brains and bodies. In spite of their challenging morphology, they usually need to be maintained for an organism's lifetime. This makes them key lesion sites in pathological processes of ageing, injury and neurodegeneration. The morphology and physiology of axons crucially depends on the parallel bundles of microtubules (MTs), running all along to serve as their structural backbones and highways for life-sustaining cargo transport and organelle dynamics. Understanding how these bundles are formed and then maintained will provide important explanations for axon biology and pathology. Currently, much is known about MTs and the proteins that bind and regulate them, but very little about how these factors functionally integrate to regulate axon biology. As an attempt to bridge between molecular mechanisms and their cellular relevance, we explain here the model of local axon homeostasis, based on our own experiments in Drosophila and published data primarily from vertebrates/mammals as well as C. elegans. The model proposes that (1) the physical forces imposed by motor protein-driven transport and dynamics in the confined axonal space, are a life-sustaining necessity, but pose a strong bias for MT bundles to become disorganised. (2) To counterbalance this risk, MT-binding and -regulating proteins of different classes work together to maintain and protect MT bundles as necessary transport highways. Loss of balance between these two fundamental processes can explain the development of axonopathies, in particular those linking to MT-regulating proteins, motors and transport defects. With this perspective in mind, we hope that more researchers incorporate MTs into their work, thus enhancing our chances of deciphering the complex regulatory networks that underpin axon biology and pathology.","Drosophila, neurodegeneration, axons, actin, cytoskeleton, microtubules",2019
sli is required for proper morphology and migration of sensory neurons in the Drosophila PNS,"Madison Gonsior, Afshan Ismat",Afshan Ismat,afshan.ismat@stthomas.edu,2019-10-24,"Neurons and glial cells coordinate with each other in many different aspects of nervous system development. Both types of cells are receiving multiple guidance cues to guide the neurons and glial cells to their proper final position. The lateral chordotonal organs (lch5) of the Drosophila peripheral nervous system (PNS) are composed of five sensory neurons surrounded by four different glial cells, scolopale cells, cap cells, attachment cells and ligament cells. During embryogenesis, the lch5 neurons go through a rotation and ventral migration to reach their final position in the lateral region of the abdomen. We show here that the extracellular ligand sli is required for the proper ventral migration and morphology of the lch5 neurons. We further show that mutations in the Sli receptors Robo and Robo2 also display similar defects as loss of sli, suggesting a role for Slit-Robo signaling in lch5 migration and positioning. Additionally, we demonstrate that the scolopale, cap and attachment cells follow the mis-migrated lch5 neurons in sli mutants, while the ventral stretching of the ligament cells seems to be independent of the lch5 neurons.

Essential to this process is the ability of developing axons to navigate guidance molecules presented by specialized populations of cells. These cells partition the distance traveled by growing axons into shorter intervals by serving as intermediate targets, orchestrating the arrival and departure of axons by providing attractive and repulsive guidance cues. The floor plate in the central nervous system (CNS) is a critical intermediate target during neuronal development, required for the extension of commissural axons across the ventral midline. In this review, we begin by giving a historical overview of the ventral commissure and the evolutionary purpose of decussation. We then review the axon guidance studies that have revealed a diverse assortment of midline guidance cues, as well as genetic and molecular regulatory mechanisms required for coordinating the commissural axon response to these cues.

Several actors have been identified in the control of this process, from tissue-scale morphogens patterning to intrinsic determinants in neural progenitor cells. In a previous study (Bonnet et al. eLife 7, 2018), we have shown that the CDC25B phosphatase promotes the transition from proliferation to differentiation by stimulating neurogenic divisions, suggesting that it acts as a maturating factor for neural progenitors. In this previous study, we set up a mathematical model linking fixed progenitor modes of division to the dynamics of progenitors and differentiated populations. Here, we extend this model over time to propose a complete dynamical picture of this process. We start from the standard paradigm that progenitors are homogeneous and can perform any type of divisions (proliferative division yielding two progenitors, asymmetric neurogenic divisions yielding one progenitor and one neuron, and terminal symmetric divisions yielding two neurons). We calibrate this model using data published by Saade et al. (Cell Reports 4, 2013) about mode of divisions and population dynamics of progenitors/neurons at different developmental stages. Next, we explore the scenarios in which the progenitor population is actually split into two different pools, one of which is composed of cells that have lost the capacity to perform proliferative divisions. The scenario in which asymmetric neurogenic division would induce such a loss of proliferative capacity appears very relevant.","CDC25B, Neural tube, Neural progenitors, Spinal cord, Proliferation, Differentiation, Proliferative capacity, Modeling",2019

Here we review recent experiments that suggest that the development of direction selectivity in carnivore visual cortex requires experience, but also suggest that the experience of an individual animal cannot greatly influence the parameters of the direction tuning that emerges, including direction angle preference and speed tuning. The direction angle preference that a neuron will acquire can be predicted from small initial biases that are present in the naïve cortex prior to the onset of visual experience. Further, experience with stimuli that move at slow or fast speeds does not alter the speed tuning properties of direction-selective neurons, suggesting that speed tuning preferences are built in. Finally, unpatterned optogenetic activation of the cortex over a period of a few hours is sufficient to produce the rapid emergence of direction selectivity in the naïve ferret cortex, suggesting that information about the direction angle preference that cells will acquire must already be present in the cortical circuit prior to experience. These results are consistent with the idea that experience has a permissive influence on the development of direction selectivity.","Motion, Thalamocortical, Development, Striate cortex, Area 17",2018

Recent work, however, has begun to fill this gap in knowledge, providing deeper insight into whether GABAergic and glycinergic circuit assembly and maintenance rely on common or distinct mechanisms. Here we summarize and contrast the developmental mechanisms that regulate the selection of synaptic partners, and that promote the formation, refinement, maturation and maintenance of GABAergic and glycinergic synapses and their respective wiring patterns. We highlight how some parts of the CNS demonstrate developmental changes in the type of inhibitory transmitter or receptor composition at their inhibitory synapses. We also consider how perturbation of the development or maintenance of one type of inhibitory connection affects other inhibitory synapse types in the same circuit.

Conditional knock-out analysis showed that Tcf7L2, but not Tcf7L1, is the principal Wnt mediator important for maintenance of progenitor cell identity in the ventricular zone. In the absence of Tcf7L2, the Wnt activity is reduced, ventricular zone markers Pax6 and Sox2 are downregulated and the neuroepithelial structure is severed due to the loss of apical adherens junctions.

The developmental events associated with the evolutionary emergence of this structure, however, remain poorly understood. A key step in callosal formation is the prior remodeling of the interhemispheric fissure by embryonic astroglial cells, which then subsequently act as a permissive substrate for callosal axons, enabling them to cross the interhemispheric midline. However, whether astroglial-mediated interhemispheric remodeling is unique to eutherian mammals, and thus possibly associated with the phylogenetic origin of the corpus callosum, or instead is a general feature of mammalian brain development, is not yet known. To investigate this, we performed a comparative analysis of interhemispheric remodeling in eutherian and non-eutherian mammals, whose lineages branched off before the evolution of the corpus callosum. Whole brain MRI analyses revealed that the interhemispheric fissure is retained into adulthood in marsupials and monotremes, in contrast to eutherians (mice), in which the fissure is significantly remodeled throughout development. Histological analyses further demonstrated that, while midline astroglia are present in developing marsupials, these cells do not intercalate with one another through the intervening interhemispheric fissure, as they do in developing mice. Thus, developing marsupials do not undergo astroglial-mediated interhemispheric remodeling. As remodeling of the interhemispheric fissure is essential for the subsequent formation of the corpus callosum in eutherians, our data highlight the role of astroglial-mediated interhemispheric remodeling in the evolutionary origin of the corpus callosum.","Interhemispheric remodeling, Interhemispheric fissure, Corpus callosum, Telencephalic commissure formation",2017

We previously found that OSN axonal projections occur sequentially, from the DM to the VL region of the OE. The differential timing of axonal projections is important for olfactory map formation because early-arriving OSN axons secrete guidance cues at the OB to help navigate late-arriving OSN axons. We hypothesized that the differential timing of axonal projections is regulated by the timing of OSN neurogenesis. To test this idea, we investigated spatiotemporal patterns of OSN neurogenesis during olfactory development.","Olfactory receptor, Olfactory sensory neuron, Neural circuit formation, Topographic map, Zonal organization, Neurogenesis",2017

In the vermis, lobules are further grouped into four anteroposterior zones (anterior, central, posterior and nodular zones) based on genetic criteria, and each has distinct lobules. Since each cerebellar afferent group projects to particular lobules and zones, it is critical to understand how the 3D structure of the Cb is acquired. During cerebellar development, the production of granule cells (gcs), the most numerous cell type in the brain, is required for foliation.

Of particular interest is its role in the Slit/Robo pathway. The Slit/Robo pathway is known to be involved in the regulation of axonal guidance and dendritic spine formation. HS mediates the Slit/Robo interaction; without its presence Slit’s repulsive activity is abrogated. Slit/Robo regulates dendritic spine formation through its interaction with srGAPs (slit-robo GTPase Activating Proteins), which leads to downstream signaling, actin cytoskeleton depolymerization and dendritic spine collapse.

An emerging role for prdm family genes in dorsoventral patterning of the vertebrate nervous system,"Denise A. Zannino, Charles G. Sagerström",Charles G. Sagerström,charles.sagerstrom@umassmed.edu,2015-10-24,"The embryonic vertebrate neural tube is divided along its dorsoventral (DV) axis into eleven molecularly discrete progenitor domains. Each of these domains gives rise to distinct neuronal cell types; the ventral-most six domains contribute to motor circuits, while the five dorsal domains contribute to sensory circuits. Following the initial neurogenesis step, these domains also generate glial cell types—either astrocytes or oligodendrocytes. This DV pattern is initiated by two morphogens—Sonic Hedgehog released from notochord and floor plate and Bone Morphogenetic Protein produced in the roof plate—that act in concentration gradients to induce expression of genes along the DV axis. Subsequently, these DV-restricted genes cooperate to define progenitor domains and to control neuronal cell fate specification and differentiation in each domain. Many genes involved in this process have been identified, but significant gaps remain in our understanding of the underlying genetic program. Here we review recent work identifying members of the Prdm gene family as novel regulators of DV patterning in the neural tube. Many Prdm proteins regulate transcription by controlling histone modifications (either via intrinsic histone methyltransferase activity, or by recruiting histone modifying enzymes). Prdm genes are expressed in spatially restricted domains along the DV axis of the neural tube and play important roles in the specification of progenitor domains, as well as in the subsequent differentiation of motor neurons and various types of interneurons. Strikingly, Prdm proteins appear to function by binding to, and modulating the activity of, other transcription factors (particularly bHLH proteins). The identity of key transcription factors in DV patterning of the neural tube has been elucidated previously (e.g. the nkx, bHLH and pax families), but it now appears that an additional family is also required and that it acts in a potentially novel manner.","Neural tube, Dorsoventral patterning, Transcription, Neural progenitor, Prdm gene family",2015

Developmental attenuation of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor subunit expression by microRNAs,"Caroline Corbel, Israel Hernandez, Bian Wu, Kenneth S. Kosik",Kenneth S. Kosik,kenneth.kosik@lifesci.ucsb.edu,2015-09-17,"N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) are a subtype of ionotropic glutamate receptors and are expressed throughout the central nervous system (CNS). Their activity is required for excitatory synaptic transmission, the developmental refinement of neural circuits and for the expression of many forms of synaptic plasticity. NMDARs are obligate heterotetramers and the expression of their constituent subunits is developmentally and anatomically regulated. In rodent cortex and hippocampus, the GluN2B subunit is expressed at high levels early in development and decreases to plateau levels later while expression of the GluN2A subunit has a concomitant increase. Regulation of GluN2A and GluN2B expressions are incompletely understood.

Polycomb group genes are required to maintain a binary fate choice in the Drosophila eye,"Jennifer K Finley, Adam C Miller, Tory G Herman",Tory G Herman,herman@molbio.uoregon.edu,2015-01-31,"Identifying the mechanisms by which cells remain irreversibly committed to their fates is a critical step toward understanding and being able to manipulate development and homeostasis. Polycomb group (PcG) proteins are chromatin modifiers that maintain transcriptional silencing, and loss of PcG genes causes widespread derepression of many developmentally important genes. However, because of their broad effects, the degree to which PcG proteins are used at specific fate choice points has not been tested. To understand how fate choices are maintained, we have been analyzing R7 photoreceptor neuron development in the fly eye. R1, R6, and R7 neurons are recruited from a pool of equivalent precursors. In order to adopt the R7 fate, these precursors make three binary choices. They: (1) adopt a neuronal fate, as a consequence of high receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) activity (they would otherwise become non-neuronal support cells); (2) fail to express Seven-up (Svp), as a consequence of Notch (N) activation (they would otherwise express Svp and become R1/R6 neurons); and (3) fail to express Senseless (Sens), as a parallel consequence of N activation (they would otherwise express Sens and become R8 neurons in the absence of Svp). We were able to remove PcG genes specifically from post-mitotic R1/R6/R7 precursors, allowing us to probe these genes' roles in the three binary fate choices that R1/R6/R7 precursors face when differentiating as R7s.","Polycomb, PRC1, Photoreceptor, R7, Fate switch, Stochastic, Notch, Senseless/Gfi-1",2015

This fate is also promoted with constitutive expression of stabilized β-Catenin in the optic cup, where the WNT pathway is up-regulated.

Pharmacologically or genetically manipulating cholinergic signaling during SRA perturbs correlated retinal ganglion cell (RGC) spiking and disrupts eye-specific retinofugal refinement in vivo, consistent with an instructive role for SRA during visual system development. Paradoxically, ablating the starburst amacrine cells (SACs) that generate cholinergic spontaneous activity disrupts correlated RGC firing without impacting retinal activity levels or eye-specific segregation in the dLGN. Such experiments suggest that patterned SRA during retinal waves is not critical for eye-specific refinement and instead, normal activity levels are permissive for retinogeniculate development.

Thus, NCCs migrating ventrally through the anterior somite form sympathetic and sensory ganglia, whereas NCCs migrating dorsolaterally form melanocytes. Although the mechanisms promoting migration along the dorsolateral path are well defined, the molecules providing positional identity to sympathetic and sensory-fated NCCs that migrate along the same ventral path are ill defined.

The intricate relationship between microtubules and their associated motor proteins during axon growth and maintenance,Andreas Prokop,Andreas Prokop,Andreas.Prokop@manchester.ac.uk,2013-09-08,"The hallmarks of neurons are their slender axons which represent the longest cellular processes of animals and which act as the cables that electrically wire the brain, and the brain to the body. Axons extend along reproducible paths during development and regeneration, and they have to be maintained for the lifetime of an organism. Both axon extension and maintenance essentially depend on the microtubule (MT) cytoskeleton. For this, MTs organize into parallel bundles that are established through extension at the leading axon tips within growth cones, and these bundles then form the architectural backbones, as well as the highways for axonal transport essential for supply and intracellular communication. Axon transport over these enormous distances takes days or even weeks and is a substantial logistical challenge. It is performed by kinesins and dynein/dynactin, which are molecular motors that form close functional links to the MTs they walk along. The intricate machinery which regulates MT dynamics, axonal transport and the motors is essential for nervous system development and function, and its investigation has huge potential to bring urgently required progress in understanding the causes of many developmental and degenerative brain disorders. During the last years new explanations for the highly specific properties of axonal MTs and for their close functional links to motor proteins have emerged, and it has become increasingly clear that motors play active roles also in regulating axonal MT networks. Here, I will provide an overview of these new developments.","Axons, Growth cones, Cytoskeleton, Microtubules, Kinesins, Dynein, Transport, Brain disorders, Drosophila",2013

Discovering whether and how neural progenitor cells that reside in the ventricular zones of Urodeles proliferate to mediate tissue repair in response to injury may produce novel leads for regenerative strategies. Here we show that endogenous neural progenitor cells resident to the ventricular zone of Urodeles spontaneously proliferate, producing progeny that migrate throughout the telencephalon before terminally differentiating into neurons. These progenitor cells appear to be responsible for telencephalon regeneration after tissue removal and their activity may be up-regulated by injury through an olfactory cue.","Axolotl, Brain regeneration, DCX, GFAP, NeuN, Neural precursor cells, Telencephalon, Ventricular zone",2013

Once they reach a choice point, axons need to switch their response from attraction to repulsion in order to move on with the next stage of their journey. The mechanisms underlying the change in axonal responsiveness are poorly understood. Commissural axons become sensitive to the repulsive activity of Slits when they cross the ventral midline of the CNS. Responsiveness to Slits depends on surface expression of Robo receptors. In Drosophila, Commissureless (Comm) plays a crucial regulatory role in midline crossing by keeping Robo levels low on precommissural axons. Interestingly, to date no vertebrate homolog of comm has been identified. Robo3/Rig1 has been shown to control Slit sensitivity before the midline, but without affecting Robo1 surface expression.","Axon guidance, In ovo RNAi, Slit, Membrane trafficking, Chicken embryo, Spinal cord development, Mental retardation gene",2012

Rediscovering the chick embryo as a model to study retinal development,"M Natalia Vergara, M Valeria Canto-Soler",M Valeria Canto-Soler,mcantos1@jhmi.edu,2012-06-27,"The embryonic chick occupies a privileged place among animal models used in developmental studies. Its rapid development and accessibility for visualization and experimental manipulation are just some of the characteristics that have made it a vertebrate model of choice for more than two millennia. Until a few years ago, the inability to perform genetic manipulations constituted a major drawback of this system. However, the completion of the chicken genome project and the development of techniques to manipulate gene expression have allowed this classic animal model to enter the molecular age. Such techniques, combined with the embryological manipulations that this system is well known for, provide a unique toolkit to study the genetic basis of neural development. A major advantage of these approaches is that they permit targeted gene misexpression with extremely high spatiotemporal resolution and over a large range of developmental stages, allowing functional analysis at a level, speed and ease that is difficult to achieve in other systems. This article provides a general overview of the chick as a developmental model focusing more specifically on its application to the study of eye development. Special emphasis is given to the state of the art of the techniques that have made gene gain- and loss-of-function studies in this model a reality.

BMP7-evoked induction, also stimulated by the closely related BMP6, acts through a Smad cascade, leading to nuclear signaling, and is not BMPR subunit selective. Orientation is evoked by BMP7, but not by BMP6, through PI3K-dependent cytoskeletal activation mediated by the type II BMPRs, ActRIIA and BMPRII and is independent of the Smad cascade. The responses can be stimulated concurrently and suggest that BMP7, but not BMP6, can selectively activate BMPR subunits that engage the divergent paths. Although structural and biochemical analyses of selected BMP/BMPR interfaces have identified key regions of interaction, how these translate into function by related BMPs is poorly understood. To determine the mechanisms underlying the distinct activities of BMP7 and the disparate properties of BMP7 and BMP6 in spinal cord development, we have performed a family-wide structure/function analysis of BMPs and used the information to predict and test sites within BMPs that may control agonist properties, in particular the ability of a BMP to orient axons, through interactions with BMPRs.","Conditioned Medium, Bone Morphogenetic Protein, Growth Cone, Bone Morphogenetic Protein Signaling, Agonist Property",2012

Here, we determined the distributions of inhibitory postsynaptic sites on the dendritic arbors of individual neurons, and compared their developmental patterns with that of excitatory postsynaptic sites. We focused on retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), the output neurons of the retina, which receive excitatory input from bipolar cells and inhibitory input from amacrine cells. To visualize and map inhibitory postsynaptic sites, we generated transgenic mice in which RGCs express fluorescently tagged Neuroligin 2 (YFP-NL2) under the control of the Thy1 promoter. By labeling RGC dendrites biolistically in YFP-NL2-expressing retinas, we were able to map the spatial distribution and thus densities of inhibitory postsynaptic sites on the dendritic arbors of individual large-field RGCs across ages.","GABAA Receptor, Bipolar Cell, Amacrine Cell, Dendritic Arbor, Excitatory Synapse",2011

Dopaminergic and RN neurons have been shown to arise from ventral mesencephalic precursors that express Sonic Hedgehog (Shh). However, Shh expression, which is initially confined to the mesencephalic ventral midline, expands laterally and is then downregulated in the ventral midline. In contrast, expression of the Hedgehog target gene Gli1 initiates in the ventral midline prior to Shh expression, but after the onset of Shh expression it is expressed in precursors lateral to Shh-positive cells. Given these dynamic gene expression patterns, Shh and Gli1 expression could delineate different progenitor populations at distinct embryonic time points.","Substantia Nigra, Ventral Tegmental Area, Ventral Midline, Ventral Mesencephalon, Gli1 Expression",2011

Each lineage exhibits a stereotypical branching pattern and trajectory, which distinguish it from other lineages. In this study, we used a multilineage approach to explore the neural function of the Par-complex member Par3/Bazooka in vivo. Drosophila bazooka is expressed in post-mitotic neurons of the larval brain and localizes within neurons in a lineage-dependent manner. The fact that multiple GAL4 drivers have been mapped to several lineages of the Drosophila brain enables investigation of the role of Bazooka from larval to adult stages Bazooka loss-of-function (LOF) clones had abnormal morphologies, including aberrant pathway choice of ventral projection neurons in the BAla1 lineage, ectopic branching in the DALv2 and BAmv1 lineages, and excess BLD5 lineage axon projections in the optic medulla. Exogenous expression of Bazooka protein in BAla1 neurons rescued defective guidance, supporting an intrinsic requirement for Bazooka in the post-mitotic neuron. Elimination of the Par-complex member Par6 recapitulated Bazooka phenotypes in some but not all lineages, suggesting that the Par complex functions in a lineage-dependent manner, and that Bazooka may act independently in some lineages.

Both pharmacological and genetic manipulations revealed that NKCC1 maintains high [Cl-]i and regulates the resting membrane potential of migratory neuroblasts whilst its functional expression is strongly reduced at the time cells reach the GCL. As in other developing systems, NKCC1 shapes GABAA-dependent signaling in the RMS neuroblasts. Also, we show that NKCC1 controls the migration of neuroblasts in the RMS. The present study indeed indicates that the latter effect results from a novel action of NKCC1 on the resting membrane potential, which is independent of GABAA-dependent signaling. All in all, our findings show that early stages of the postnatal recruitment of OB interneurons rely on precise, orchestrated mechanisms that depend on multiple actions of NKCC1.","GABAA Receptor, Rest Membrane Potential, Bumetanide, Granule Cell Layer, Gramicidin",2011

Developmental control of lateralized neuron size in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans,"Andrew D Goldsmith, Sumeet Sarin, Shawn Lockery, Oliver Hobert",Oliver Hobert,or38@columbia.edu,2010-12-01,"Nervous systems are generally bilaterally symmetric on a gross structural and organizational level but are strongly lateralized (left/right asymmetric) on a functional level. It has been previously noted that in vertebrate nervous systems, symmetrically positioned, bilateral groups of neurons in functionally lateralized brain regions differ in the size of their soma. The genetic mechanisms that control these left/right asymmetric soma size differences are unknown. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans offers the opportunity to study this question with single neuron resolution. A pair of chemosensory neurons (ASEL and ASER), which are bilaterally symmetric on several levels (projections, synaptic connectivity, gene expression patterns), are functionally lateralized in that they express distinct chemoreceptors and sense distinct chemosensory cues.","Optic Tectum, Nucleolar Protein, Soma Size, Neuron Pair, Neuron Size",2010

Here, we report the identification of two additional isoforms and propose a link between the expression of these isoforms and cancer. These novel isoforms, NUMB5 and NUMB6, lack exon 10 and are expressed in cells known for polarity and migratory behavior, such as human amniotic fluid cells, glioblastoma and metastatic tumor cells. RT-PCR and luciferase assays demonstrate that NUMB5 and NUMB6 are less antagonistic to NOTCH signaling than other NUMB isoforms. Immunocytochemistry analyses show that NUMB5 and NUMB6 interact and complex with CDC42, vimentin and the CDC42 regulator IQGAP1 (IQ (motif) GTPase activating protein 1). Furthermore, the ectopic expression of NUMB5 and NUMB6 induces the formation of lamellipodia (NUMB5) and filopodia (NUMB6) in a CDC42- and RAC1-dependent manner. These results are complemented by in vitro and in vivo studies, demonstrating that NUMB5 and NUMB6 alter the migratory behavior of cells. Together, these novel isoforms may play a role in further understanding the NUMB function in development and cancer.","Notch Signaling, Retinoic Acid Treatment, Proline Rich Region, Amniotic Fluid Cell, Cortical Progenitor",2010

Ihog and Boi are essential for Hedgehog signaling in Drosophila,"Darius Camp, Ko Currie, Alain Labbé, Donald J van Meyel, Frédéric Charron",Donald J van Meyel,don.vanmeyel@mcgill.ca,2010-11-02,"The Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway is important for the development of a variety of tissues in both vertebrates and invertebrates. For example, in developing nervous systems Hh signaling is required for the normal differentiation of neural progenitors into mature neurons. The molecular signaling mechanism underlying the function of Hh is not fully understood. In Drosophila, Ihog (Interference hedgehog) and Boi (Brother of Ihog) are related transmembrane proteins of the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) with orthologs in vertebrates. Members of this IgSF subfamily have been shown to bind Hh and promote pathway activation but their exact role in the Hh signaling pathway has remained elusive. To better understand this role in vivo, we generated loss-of-function mutations of the ihog and boi genes, and investigated their effects in developing eye and wing imaginal discs.","Anterior Compartment, Wing Disc, Wing Imaginal Disc, Morphogenetic Furrow, Compartment Boundary",2010

Interactions between Hedgehog and Notch have been reported in normal brain development as well as in Hedgehog pathway induced medulloblastoma but the molecular details of this interaction are not known and we investigate here the role of Notch signalling in the development of the EGL and the intersection between the two pathways in cerebellar granule neuron progenitors and in medulloblastoma.","Proliferate Cell Nuclear Antigen, Medulloblastoma, Notch Signalling, Notch Pathway, Cerebellar Development",2010
Drosophilatype II neuroblast lineages keep Prospero levels low to generate large clones that contribute to the adult brain central complex,"Omer Ali Bayraktar, Jason Q Boone, Michael L Drummond, Chris Q Doe",Chris Q Doe,cdoe@uoregon.edu,2010-10-01,"Tissue homeostasis depends on the ability of stem cells to properly regulate self-renewal versus differentiation. Drosophila neural stem cells (neuroblasts) are a model system to study self-renewal and differentiation. Recent work has identified two types of larval neuroblasts that have different self-renewal/differentiation properties. Type I neuroblasts bud off a series of small basal daughter cells (ganglion mother cells) that each generate two neurons. Type II neuroblasts bud off small basal daughter cells called intermediate progenitors (INPs), with each INP generating 6 to 12 neurons. Type I neuroblasts and INPs have nuclear Asense and cytoplasmic Prospero, whereas type II neuroblasts lack both these transcription factors. Here we test whether Prospero distinguishes type I/II neuroblast identity or proliferation profile, using several newly characterized Gal4 lines. We misexpress prospero using the R19H09-Gal4 line (expressed in type II neuroblasts but no adjacent type I neuroblasts) or R9D11-Gal4 line (expressed in INPs but not type II neuroblasts). We find that differential prospero expression does not distinguish type I and type II neuroblast identities, but Prospero regulates proliferation in both type I and type II neuroblast lineages. In addition, we use R9D11 lineage tracing to show that type II lineages generate both small-field and large-field neurons within the adult central complex, a brain region required for locomotion, flight, and visual pattern memory.","Green Fluorescent Protein, Central Complex, Mushroom Body, Optic Lobe, Axon Projection",2010
Context-dependent functions of specific microRNAs in neuronal development,Fen-Biao Gao,Fen-Biao Gao,fen-biao.gao@umassmed.edu,2010-10-01,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs that regulate multiple developmental processes at the post-transcriptional level. Recent rapid progresses have demonstrated critical roles for a number of miRNAs in neuronal development and function. In particular, miR-9 and miR-124 are specifically expressed in the mammalian nervous system, and their respective nucleotide sequences are 100% identical among many species. Yet, their expression patterns and mRNA targets are less conserved throughout evolution. As a consequence, these miRNAs exhibit diverse context-dependent functions in different aspects of neuronal development, ranging from early neurogenesis and neuronal differentiation to dendritic morphogenesis and synaptic plasticity. Some other neuronal miRNAs also exhibit context-dependent functions in development. Thus, post-transcriptional regulation of spatial and temporal expression levels of protein-coding genes by miRNAs contributes uniquely to the proper development and evolution of the complex nervous system.","Neuronal Differentiation, cAMP Response Element Binding, Early Neurogenesis, Spine Morphogenesis, Dendritic Morphogenesis",2010

Axon fasciculation in the developing olfactory nerve,"Alexandra M Miller, Lydia R Maurer, Dong-Jing Zou, Stuart Firestein, Charles A Greer",Charles A Greer,charles.greer@yale.edu,2010-08-19,"Olfactory sensory neuron (OSN) axons exit the olfactory epithelium (OE) and extend toward the olfactory bulb (OB) where they coalesce into glomeruli. Each OSN expresses only 1 of approximately 1,200 odor receptors (ORs). OSNs expressing the same OR are distributed in restricted zones of the OE. However, within a zone, the OSNs expressing a specific OR are not contiguous - distribution appears stochastic. Upon reaching the OB the OSN axons expressing the same OR reproducibly coalesce into two to three glomeruli. While ORs appear necessary for appropriate convergence of axons, a variety of adhesion associated molecules and activity-dependent mechanisms are also implicated. Recent data suggest pre-target OSN axon sorting may influence glomerular convergence. Here, using regional and OR-specific markers, we addressed the spatio-temporal properties associated with the onset of homotypic fasciculation in embryonic mice and assessed the degree to which subpopulations of axons remain segregated as they extend toward the nascent OB. We show that immediately upon crossing the basal lamina, axons uniformly turn sharply, usually at an approximately 90° angle toward the OB. Molecularly defined subpopulations of axons show evidence of spatial segregation within the nascent nerve by embryonic day 12, within 48 hours of the first OSN axons crossing the basal lamina, but at least 72 hours before synapse formation in the developing OB. Homotypic fasciculation of OSN axons expressing the same OR appears to be a hierarchical process. While regional segregation occurs in the mesenchyme, the final convergence of OR-specific subpopulations does not occur until the axons reach the inner nerve layer of the OB.","Olfactory Bulb, Basal Lamina, Olfactory Epithelium, Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule, Olfactory Nerve",2010

Brn3a regulates neuronal subtype specification in the trigeminal ganglion by promoting Runx expression during sensory differentiation,"Iain M Dykes, Jason Lanier, S Raisa Eng, Eric E Turner",Eric E Turner,eric.turner@seattlechildrens.org,2010-01-22,"The transcription factor Brn3a, product of the pou4f1 gene, is expressed in most sensory neurons throughout embryogenesis. Prior work has demonstrated a role for Brn3a in the repression of early neurogenic genes; here we describe a second major role for Brn3a in the specification of sensory subtypes in the trigeminal ganglion (TG). Sensory neurons initially co-express multiple Trk-family neurotrophin receptors, but are later marked by the unique expression of TrkA, TrkB or TrkC. Maturation of these sensory subtypes is known to depend on the expression of Runx transcription factors. Newborn Brn3a knockout mice fail to express TrkC, which is associated in the TG with mechanoreceptors, plus a set of functional genes associated with nociceptor subtypes. In embryonic Brn3a-/- ganglia, the normal expression of Runx3 is never initiated in TrkC+ neurons, and Runx1 expression is greatly attenuated in TrkA+ nociceptors. These changes are accompanied by expanded expression of TrkB in neurons that abnormally express multiple Trks, followed by the loss of TrkC and TrkA expression. In transgenic embryos expressing a Brn3a-VP16 dominant transactivator, Runx3 mRNA expression is increased, suggesting that it is a direct regulatory target of Brn3a. Chromatin immunoprecipitation confirms that Brn3a binds in vivo to a conserved upstream enhancer element within histone H3-acetylated chromatin in the Runx3 locus. Together these data show that Brn3a acts upstream of the Runx factors, which then repress TrkB expression to allow establishment of the non-overlapping Trk receptor profiles and correct terminally differentiated phenotypes.","Dorsal Root Ganglion, Sensory Neuron, Trigeminal Ganglion, Calcitonin Gene Related Peptide, Runx3 Expression",2010

Promotion of embryonic cortico-cerebral neuronogenesis by miR-124,"Nicola Antonio Maiorano, Antonello Mallamaci",Antonello Mallamaci,amallama@sissa.it,2009-11-02,"Glutamatergic neurons of the murine cerebral cortex are generated within periventricular proliferative layers of the embryonic pallium, directly from apical precursors or indirectly via their basal progenies. Cortical neuronogenesis is the result of different morphogenetic subroutines, including precursor proliferation and death, changes in histogenetic potencies, and post-mitotic neuronal differentiation. Control of these processes is extremely complex, involving numerous polypeptide-encoding genes. Moreover, many so-called 'non-coding genes' are also expressed in the developing cortex. Currently, their implication in corticogenesis is the subject of intensive functional studies. A subset of them encodes microRNAs (miRNAs), a class of small RNAs with complex biogenesis that regulate gene expression at multiple levels and modulate histogenetic progression and are implicated in refinement of positional information. Among the cortical miRNAs, miR-124 has been consistently shown to promote neuronogenesis progression in a variety of experimental contexts.

Notch activity in the nervous system: to switch or not switch?,"Elise Cau, Patrick Blader",Elise Cau,cau@cict.fr,2009-10-02,"The Notch pathway is instrumental for cell fate diversification during development. Pioneer studies conducted in Drosophila and more recent work performed in vertebrates have shown that in the nervous system, Notch is reiteratively employed when cells choose between two alternative fates, a process referred to as a binary fate decision. While the early (neural versus epidermal) fate decisions mainly involve an inhibitory effect of Notch on the neural fate, late fate decisions (choice between different subtypes of neural cells) have been proposed to involve a binary switch activity whereby Notch would be instructive for one fate and inhibitory for the other. We re-examine this binary switch model in light of two recent findings made in the vertebrate nervous system. First, in the zebrafish epiphysis, Notch is required to resolve a mixed identity through the inhibition of one specific fate. Second, in the murine telencephalon, Notch regulates the competence of neural progenitors to respond to the JAK/STAT pathway, thereby allowing for the induction of an astrocyte fate. In neither case is Notch instructive for the alternative fate, but rather cooperates with another signalling pathway to coordinate binary fate choices. We also review current knowledge on the molecular cascades acting downstream of Notch in the context of neural subtype diversification, a crucial issue if one is to determine Notch function as an instructive, permissive or inhibitory signal in the various cellular contexts where it is implicated. Finally, we speculate as to how such a 'non-switch' activity could contribute to the expansion of neuronal subtype diversity.","Neural Progenitor, Notch Pathway, Proneural Gene, Neural Fate, Binary Switch",2009

The reiterated anteroposterior compartments of the developing hindbrain (rhombomeres (r)) are normally patterned by the combinatorial action of distinct Hox genes. Alteration in the normal pattern of Hox cues in this region results in a transformation of cellular identity to match the remaining Hox profile, similar to that observed in Drosophila homeotic transformations.","Homeotic Transformation, Facial Motor Nucleus, Rhombomere Boundary, Cranial Motor Neuron, Cyp1B1 Transcript",2009

Basal laminas in general are composed of four main types of glycosylated proteins: laminins, collagens IV, heparan sulfate proteoglycans and nidogens (entactins). The portion of the muscle fiber basal lamina that passes between the motor nerve terminal and postsynaptic membrane has been shown to bear distinct isoforms of the first three of these. For laminins and collagens IV, the proteins are deposited by the muscle; a synaptic proteoglycan, z-agrin, is deposited by the nerve.

While anatomical and physiological aspects of bipolar types have been actively studied, little is known about the sequence of events that leads to bipolar cell type specification and the potential relationship this process may have with synapse formation in the outer plexiform layer. In this study, we have examined the birth order of rod and cone bipolar cells in the developing mouse and rat in vivo.","Bipolar Cell, Outer Plexiform Layer, Inner Plexiform Layer, Cone Photoreceptor, Adult Retina",2008

Semaphorin6A acts as a gate keeper between the central and the peripheral nervous system,"Olivier Mauti, Elena Domanitskaya, Irwin Andermatt, Rejina Sadhu, Esther T Stoeckli",Esther T Stoeckli,Esther.Stoeckli@zool.uzh.ch,2007-12-18,"During spinal cord development, expression of chicken SEMAPHORIN6A (SEMA6A) is almost exclusively found in the boundary caps at the ventral motor axon exit point and at the dorsal root entry site. The boundary cap cells are derived from a population of late migrating neural crest cells. They form a transient structure at the transition zone between the peripheral nervous system (PNS) and the central nervous system (CNS). Ablation of the boundary cap resulted in emigration of motoneurons from the ventral spinal cord along the ventral roots. Based on its very restricted expression in boundary cap cells, we tested for a role of Sema6A as a gate keeper between the CNS and the PNS.","Dorsal Root Ganglion, Neural Crest Cell, Stop Signal, Ventral Root, Motor Axon",2007

A procephalic territory in Drosophila exhibiting similarities and dissimilarities compared to the vertebrate midbrain/hindbrain boundary region,Rolf Urbach,Rolf Urbach,urbach@uni-mainz.de,2007-11-05,"In vertebrates, the primordium of the brain is subdivided by the expression of Otx genes (forebrain/anterior midbrain), Hox genes (posterior hindbrain), and the genes Pax2, Pax5 and Pax8 (intervening region). The latter includes the midbrain/hindbrain boundary (MHB), which acts as a key organizer during brain patterning. Recent studies in Drosophila revealed that orthologous sets of genes are expressed in a similar tripartite pattern in the late embryonic brain, which suggested correspondence between the Drosophila deutocerebral/tritocerebral boundary region and the vertebrate MHB. To gain more insight into the evolution of brain regions, and particularly the MHB, I examined the expression of a comprehensive array of MHB-specific gene orthologs in the procephalic neuroectoderm and in individually identified neuroblasts during early embryonic stages 8-11, at which the segmental organization of the brain is most clearly displayed.","Ventral Nerve Cord, Embryonic Brain, Intervene Zone, Embryonic Brain Development, Invertebrate Chordate",2007

These are neural crest derivatives that transiently reside at motor exit points, central nervous system (CNS):peripheral nervous system (PNS) interfaces where motor axons leave the CNS. In the absence of boundary cap cells, motor neuron cell bodies migrate along their axons into the periphery, suggesting that repellent signals from boundary cap cells regulate the selective gating of somal migration and axon outgrowth at the motor exit point.

The connectivity and function of such feedback neurons are themselves subject to alteration by external cues, such as hormones, stress, or experience.

Sp8 exhibits reciprocal induction with Fgf8 but has an opposing effect on anterior-posterior cortical area patterning,"Setsuko Sahara, Yasuhiko Kawakami, Juan Carlos Izpisua Belmonte, Dennis DM O'Leary",Dennis DM O'Leary,doleary@salk.edu,2007-05-17,"Telencephalic patterning centers, defined by the discrete expression domains of distinct morphogens, Fgf s in the commissural plate (CoP), Wnt s and Bmp s in the cortical hem, and a ventral domain of Sonic hedgehog (Shh), are postulated to establish during development the initial patterning of the telencepahlon, including the neocortex. We show that the expression patterns of Sp5, Sp8, and Sp9, members of the Sp8-like family that are homologues of Drosophila buttonhead, correlate during early embryonic development with these three telencephalic patterning centers. To study potential functional relationships, we focused on Sp8, because it is transiently expressed in the CoP coincident with the expression of Fgf8, a morphogen implicated in area patterning of the neocortex. We also show that Sp8 is expressed in cortical progenitors in a high to low anterior-medial to posterior-lateral gradient across the ventricular zone. We used in utero electroporation of full-length and chimeric expression constructs to perform gain-of-function and loss-of-function studies of interactions between Sp8 and Fgf8 and their roles in cortical area patterning. We show that Fgf8 and Sp8 exhibit reciprocal induction in vivo in the embryonic telencephalon. Sp8 also induces downstream targets of Fgf8, including ETS transcription factors. In vitro assays show that Sp8 binds Fgf8 regulatory elements and is a direct transcriptional activator of Fgf8. We also show that Sp8 induction of Fgf8 is repressed by Emx2 in vitro, suggesting a mechanism to limit Fgf8 expression to the CoP. In vivo expression of a dominant negative Sp8 in the CoP indicates that Sp8 maintains expression of Fgf8 and also its effect on area patterning. Ectopic expression of Sp8 in anterior or posterior cortical poles induces significant anterior or posterior shifts in area patterning, respectively, paralleled by changes in expression of gene markers of positional identity. These effects of Sp8 on area patterning oppose those induced by ectopic expression of Fgf8, suggesting that in parallel to regulating Fgf8 expression, Sp8 also activates a distinct signaling pathway for cortical area patterning. In summary, Sp8 and Fgf8 robustly induce one another, and may act to balance the anterior-posterior area patterning of the cortex.","Fgf8 Signaling, Fgf8 Expression, Medial Ganglionic Eminence, Choroid Plexus Epithelium, Area Patterning",2007

This phenomenon was first described more than a century ago and, over the past decades, increasing insights have been gained into the cellular and molecular mechanisms regulating neuronal growth and navigation. Progress in this area has been greatly assisted by the use of simple and genetically tractable invertebrate model systems, such as the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. This review is dedicated to Drosophila as a genetic and cellular model to study axonal growth and demonstrates how it can and has been used for this research. We describe the various cellular systems of Drosophila used for such studies, insights into axonal growth cones and their cytoskeletal dynamics, and summarise identified molecular signalling pathways required for growth cone navigation, with particular focus on pathfinding decisions in the ventral nerve cord of Drosophila embryos.

This suggested to us that eye development might be an appropriate model to verify if homeoprotein intercellular passage has important functions in early development. Similar to other homeoproteins, Pax6 has two domains that enable secretion and internalization by live cells and, thus, intercellular passage. In principle, a straightforward way to test the hypothesis would be to mutate one of the two sequences to produce a 'cell autonomous only' Pax6. However, this was not possible because these sequences are in the homeodomain and their modification would affect Pax6 transcriptional properties.

Polarization and orientation of retinal ganglion cells in vivo,"Flavio R Zolessi, Lucia Poggi, Christopher J Wilkinson, Chi-Bin Chien, William A Harris",William A Harris,harris@mole.bio.cam.ac.uk,2006-10-13,"In the absence of external cues, neurons in vitro polarize by using intrinsic mechanisms. For example, cultured hippocampal neurons extend arbitrarily oriented neurites and then one of these, usually the one nearest the centrosome, begins to grow more quickly than the others. This neurite becomes the axon as it accumulates molecular components of the apical junctional complex. All the other neurites become dendrites. It is unclear, however, whether neurons in vivo, which differentiate within a polarized epithelium, break symmetry by using similar intrinsic mechanisms. To investigate this, we use four-dimensional microscopy of developing retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) in live zebrafish embryos. We find that the situation is indeed very different in vivo, where axons emerge directly from uniformly polarized cells in the absence of other neurites. In vivo, moreover, components of the apical complex do not localize to the emerging axon, nor does the centrosome predict the site of axon emergence. Mosaic analysis in four dimensions, using mutants in which neuroepithelial polarity is disrupted, indicates that extrinsic factors such as access to the basal lamina are critical for normal axon emergence from RGCs in vivo.","Retinal Pigment Epithelium, Enhance Green Fluorescent Protein, Basal Lamina, Retinal Ganglion Cell, Axon Emergence",2006
